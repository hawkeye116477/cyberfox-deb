## Source

Cyberfox KDE Plasma Edition contains <a href="http://www.rosenauer.org/hg/mozilla/file/tip/">OpenSuse's KDE patches</a> and <a href="https://github.com/manjaro/packages-community/blob/master/firefox-kde/fix-wifi-scanner.diff">fix-wifi-scanner.diff</a>.

#### Warning! Due to the fact that lately the interest in Cyberfox is smaller and I am using Waterfox now, there will be no updates in my repository anymore. However, this can change if Cyberfox ever abandones ESR and will return to its cycle.
