Cyberfox linux version currently does not install like the firefox version.
We are working on this.

How to use:
Extract to a safe location and start cyberfox.

How to update:
Delete your old cyberfox folder and replace it with the new one.

Need help or support, While we don't officially support linux and this is an unofficial build we do provide limited support at this stage.

This is our linux thread https://8pecxstudios.com/Forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1374
If you have an issue please feel free to post it there or if willing to help make cyberfox linux become official
by helping with its development by providing information on how to make it install like firefox etc then please
feel free to help :)
