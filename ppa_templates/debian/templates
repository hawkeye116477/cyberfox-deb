Description: Do you want to update Cyberfox together with the rest of the system?
 Cyberfox can configure your system to include new versions of the Cyberfox
 package together with the regular system upgrades. Enabling this option
 is highly recommended to make sure you receive critical security
 updates in a timely manner.
 .
 If you agree, Cyberfox will install a file into /etc/apt/sources.list.d,
 so that the Cyberfox package is upgraded to any available newer release
 as part of your regular system upgrade.
